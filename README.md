## Description

As a bootcamp student, I want to be as prepared as possible for the first day of class so I created this website to hold my notes as I learned how to build a website for the first time. With this project, I will be able to keep track of the notes I take as I learn more about creating websites.
By completing this project, I learned how to create a framework using HTML, how to decorate that framework using CSS, and how to make that framework interactive using JavaScript.
